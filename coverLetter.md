Hi Rubble,
I have read your problem . I have understood that you have want to making a website look like https://ducc.pythonanywhere.com/flaggle/ . But you like simple difference where only include flags of countries, not territories.
I am able to make those type of website.
Kindly check my previous work: saddamsaddam/OnlineExamSystem (github.com) saddamsaddam/IncomeTaxBd (github.com) saddamsaddam/Player_bidding_system (github.com)

look forward to working with you
Thanks
Md Saddam Hossen
